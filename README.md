Default-FS
==========

A minimal filesystem driver for Linux

This Filesystem is based on the Linux Driver Workshops conducted by Anil Kumar Pugalia <email@sarika-pugs.com>.
Many of them are w.r.t. the custom hardware DDK. For version compatibility,
look into the file VERSIONS.

You may compile these templates by typing make in the toplevel folder or
individual folders after setting the KERNEL_SOURCE variable to your kernel's
source directory in the top-level Makefile & module.mk
