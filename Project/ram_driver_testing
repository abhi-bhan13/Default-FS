1.Make change in the Makefile to compile the Ram block driver.

2.Insert the driver as a kernel module.

3.Now your RAM works as a block driver which can be viewed by the following command-
ls -l /dev/rb*
All the partition are displayed.

4.Now copy the first sector on any patition by the following command-
dd if=/dev/rb of=dor count=1
Partition rb's first sector has got copied to dor.

5.Now view the contents of the dor file with the following command-
xxd dor
The first sector is the MBR which you copied into dor. The last byte would be 0x55aa which is the signature.

6. Anytime you can display, add or delete the partitions by the following command- 
fdisk /dev/rb.

7.Quick format any partition with the fs of your choice. eg:minix
mkfs.minix /dev/rb3

8. Mount the partition with the same filesystem.
mount -t minix /dev/rb3 /mnt 

9. Check whether the partition is mounted with the following command-
df
